/*# Unit 03 Mini-Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this activity, you will work with a group to build a game using only JavaScript.

## Instructions

The completed application should meet the following criteria:

*  

* As a user, I expect the computer to choose R, P, or S in return.

* As a user, I want the option to play again whether I win or lose.

* As a user, I want to see my total wins, ties, and losses after each round.

### Specifications

* Must use the `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` methods to collect user input and display information to the user.

* The computer's selection must be random to ensure a fair game.
